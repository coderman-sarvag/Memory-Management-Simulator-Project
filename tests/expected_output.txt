EXPECTED OUTPUT DESCRIPTION

CACHE TEST:
- Initial accesses result in cache misses (cold misses).
- Subsequent access to previously loaded block may result in L1/L2/L3 hit.
- FIFO replacement evicts the oldest block in each set.
- cache_stats shows hits, misses, and hit ratios per cache level.

VIRTUAL MEMORY TEST:
- First accesses generate page faults.
- Under FIFO, pages are evicted in order of arrival.
- Under LRU, the least recently used page is evicted.
- vm_stats displays page hits and page faults for each policy.

NOTE:
Exact hit/miss counts may vary depending on cache configuration,
but qualitative behavior must match the described policy.
